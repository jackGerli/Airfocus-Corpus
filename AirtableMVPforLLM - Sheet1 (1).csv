Text analytics,"# Overview
 
 Analyzing qualitative \(verbatim\) data and converting it into a qualitative \(metric\) value is mentally taxing and incredibly tedious for our users. For those teams that have the resources \(headcount\) and the time, they manually review all open ended feedback, applying themes to each response based on defined ‚Äúcode-books‚Äù \(i.e. tagging rules/conventions\). The output of this activity is a count of the most frequent themes found in open ended feedback, for a specified period. If performed at all, these activities occur entirely outside of Delighted. On varying cadences, they report on this data, providing trending summaries of each theme, with illustrative quotes. For tenured analysts, response coding is a cumbersome activity, often taking up to 1hr per 100 responses.
 
 * Problem 1: the task of coding qualitative data is tedious and dependent on manual effort. 
 
 Churn data, feedback from customer interviews and even our own NPS data indicate that Delighted‚Äôs reporting & analytical tools leave much to be desired ‚Äî 17% of NPS feedback we received in the ‚Äò22 churn report pointed to a need for better text analytics.
 
 * Problem 2: despite customer demand and product development from competition in adjacent markets, we don‚Äôt currently have a productized approach that allows customer to extract value from aggregate, open ended feedback. 
 
 We need to explore and develop a new method of handling open-ended feedback that can effectively analyze and leverage qualitative data, includes customer input / modeling, and carries a specific lens on our customers and existing product.

 **Impact**
 
 Spring‚Äô23 these will be retired and unavailable which would lead calls to fail for applications consuming versions as these endpoints will not be found.
 
 Salesforce will not provide technical support or bug fixes for issues raised in connection with the use of API versions 21.0 through 30.0. Also, API versions 7.0 through 20.0 have been retired and are unavailable with the Summer ‚Äô22 release.
 
 Applications that use versions 21.0 through 30.0 of the \[Web Services Connector\]\(https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.salesforce\_developer\_environment\_tipsheet.meta/salesforce\_developer\_environment\_tipsheet/salesforce\_developer\_environment\_wsc.htm\) will also be impacted due to this retirement.
 
 Versions 30.0 and below of the \[Data Loader\]\(https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.data\_loader.htm&type=5&language=en\_US\) client application that consumes affected API versions will also be impacted due to this retirement.
 
 
 
 Applications using affected WSC versions will need to adopt a more \[current release\]\(https://github.com/forcedotcom/wsc/releases/\) of the framework.
 
 
 
 Users of affected Data Loader versions will need to adopt a more \[current release\]\(https://github.com/forcedotcom/dataloader/releases/\) of the client application.
 
 
 
 **Request**
 
 Prior to the Summer '23 release, customers and partners must modify or upgrade their applications to function with the most current API versions. Can we upgrade Delighted Salesforce application to the most current API version to avoid breaking of integration for our customers?

Single-page customization,"Delighted does not support the ability to view all survey customizations in a single page view.

This is either because they have a difficult time finding it or because it‚Äôs not shown to them when they first customize the survey."
